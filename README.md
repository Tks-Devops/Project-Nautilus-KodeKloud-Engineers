# Project-Nautilus-KodeKloud-Engineers
"This repository demonstrates the system architecture and deployment of the Nautilus application, a project conducted as part of the KodeKloud Initiative Program to build foundational DevOps and SysAdmin skills."
# Project Nautilus




**Project Name**: Nautilus  
**Program**: KodeKloud Initiative Program  
**Role**: System Administrator (DevOps Engineer in Training)  
**Duration**: Apr 2020 - Present

## Overview

Project Nautilus is the Naval subdivision of xFusionCorp Industries. The project aims to help the Naval forces make smart procurement decisions for their manned or unmanned maritime systems while ensuring that the operational requirements are met. Additionally, it aims to improve operational support, safety, and the life extension of existing systems, all while reducing the cost of ownership.

## Project Architecture

The Nautilus application uses a **three-tier architecture**:

- **Data Tier**: MariaDB database for data storage and retrieval.
- **Application Tier**: LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP) for web application support.
- **Client Tier**: Web browser processing HTML resources and handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx for HTTP load balancing across multiple application servers.

### Key Features

- **Sonar Technology** and Systems
- **LUSV** - Large Unmanned Surface Vehicles
- **Autonomous Unmanned Undersea Pods**
- **Nuclear Submarines**
- **Laser Guidance Systems**

## Infrastructure Details

This project is deployed in a **North America** region's data center with the following infrastructure:

- **Servers**: Multiple application servers, backup servers, and load balancers
- **Storage**: Network Attached Storage (NAS) for reliable external storage
- **SFTP & Jump Servers**: For secure file transfers and remote access

### Tools & Technologies Used

- **Linux** (System Administration)
- **MariaDB** (Database)
- **LAMP Stack** (Web Development)
- **Nginx** (Load Balancing)
- **Docker & Jenkins** (CI/CD)
- **SSH & SFTP** (Secure Remote Connections)

## Key Achievements

- Gaining hands-on experience with **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.
- Developing **CI/CD pipelines** using **Jenkins**.
- Implementing **DevOps best practices** from a **SysAdmin perspective**.

## Future Work

The goal is to continue transitioning from traditional SysAdmin roles to more advanced **DevOps**, **Cloud**, and **SRE** concepts.
